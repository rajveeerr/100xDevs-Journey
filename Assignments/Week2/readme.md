# Week 2 Assignments & Class Notes

This directory contains all the assignments I've completed and the class notes I've taken during Week 2 of the 100xDevs Web Development Cohort 3.

## Directory Structure

### `100xDevs-Journey/Assignments/Week2/`
This directory contains all the assignments I've completed and class notes taken during Week 2 of the 100xDevs Web Development Cohort 3.

#### **Class Assignments**
These tasks were provided during the live class sessions. I've worked on and implemented the following, as assigned by Harkirat:

- **`promisifiedSetTimeout.js`** - A function that returns a promise that resolves after a specified delay.
- **`promisifiedReadFile.js`** - A function that reads a file using promises.
- **`promisifiedWriteFile.js`** - A function that writes to a file using promises.
- **`promisifiedCleanFile.js`** - A function that cleans up a file's content, implemented with promises.

All these functions are included in the `classAssignments.js` file. The files `classNotesWeek2.1.js` and `classNotesWeek2.2.js` contain all the class notes I've taken.

### `100xDevs-Journey/Assignments/Week2/assignments-main/`
This directory contains all the assignments provided by Harkirat outside of the live classes. These assignments were pulled from the official repository [here](https://github.com/100xdevs-cohort-3/assignments/tree/main).

- **`week-2/week-2-async-js/`**: Contains assignments related to asynchronous JavaScript.
- **`week-2/week-2-js/`**: Contains other JavaScript-related assignments from Week 2.
